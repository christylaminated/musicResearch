            <h2>Kendrick Lamar's DNA exemplifies how structured rhythmic and linguistic complexity can enhance cognitive engagement. With verses containing tightly controlled rhythmic precision, syncopation, and shifting cadences, requiring listeners to process complex patterns in real time. Additionally, Lamar’s use of rhythm, alliteration, and layered metaphors require active engagement, which mirrors the cognitive benefits associated with classical music’s structured compositions. This suggests that rap, with its mathematically precise rhythmic structures, can offer similar cognitive benefits to classical compositions when actively engaged with, further challenging the myth that only classical music enhances intelligence.</h2>        </section>

            <h2>Nas’s I Gave You Power shows how intricate narrative structures in rap music can foster critical thinking and cognitive engagement. The song uses first person storytelling from the perspective of a gun, which creates a layered, symbolic narrative. This demands listeners to decipher meaning beyond surface-level lyrics. Additionally, the track’s measured flow and rhythm create a rhythmic predictability that mirrors the structured patterns found in classical compositions. The way Nas weaves social commentary into his storytelling further demonstrates how rap can enhance analytical skills, as listeners must piece together context, metaphors, and historical references.</h2>        </section>

            <h1>Lofi</h1>
            <h2>The track maintains a steady 4/4 time signature, with a soft piano melody repeating over a relaxed drum loop. This rhythmic regularity plays a key role in cognitive engagement by providing a predictable auditory structure that helps the brain process information efficiently. Because Snowman isn’t classical music, and follows a repetitive yet subtly evolving format, it shows that structured engagement with music, not genre, enhances cognitive function. </h2>

            <h2>The song’s use of soft, reverb-drenched chords and melancholic melodic phrasing creates a calming effect, while its structured repetition helps listeners focus without cognitive overload. Just as classical music’s predictable patterns contribute to concentration, The Girl I Haven’t Met fosters mental clarity through its balance of repetition and subtle variations. By demonstrating that structured engagement with rhythm and melody is key to cognitive benefits, this track further challenges the myth that only classical compositions enhance intelligence, proving that lo-fi’s rhythmic stability can offer similar advantages.</h2>
